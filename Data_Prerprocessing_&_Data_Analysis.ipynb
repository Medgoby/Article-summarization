            "(CNN)Under harsh lights in a private, rented room in Berlin, women face each other in violent, sometimes bloody battles of brute strength.\r\n",
            "There are no official rules to this female fight club. The fighters are both beginners and professionals, anywhere from age 20 to 50, said photographer Katarzyna Mazur, who spent months documenting the club in 2013 and 2014.\r\n",
            "Led by founders nicknamed Anna Konda and Red Devil, a match might pit a bodybuilder against a martial arts master. They can wrestle, throw punches or \"cat fight.\" There's no judge, just someone who knows the parameters they've decided for the match. The small audience is mostly made up of men, but it's a place for women to shed the roles they play outside.\r\n",
            "\"When I saw this kind of fighting for the first time, I was quite shocked. I had never seen something like that before, and it was really interesting to experience all of this so close,\" said Mazur, who photographed the fight club as part of her work toward graduation from photography school. \"Inhibition and fear do not exist on the mat.\"\r\n",
            "At first, Mazur said, she shot the fight club in color, but the look of the blue mat and neon lights didn't satisfy her. She shifted to black-and-white images and reduced her point of view, getting as close as she could to the action.\r\n",
            "\"It was not easy to work like that, because the matches were going very quickly and were unpredictable,\" she said, although fighters were respectful and would stop if someone was seriously hurt. \"I had to be very careful not to get hit. Fortunately, there are chairs on the side, so I could jump on them if the female fighters suddenly rolled under my feet.\"\r\n",
            "For all the aggression built into fighting, Mazur said, the project required a lot of sensitivity. She had to work quickly, and she didn't always know her subjects well. The bouts, the motivations, the scene can all leave a lot of room for interpretation. Mazur said she had to examine her own limitations, questioning \"How far can I go? Do they trust me? Am I allowed to do that?\"\r\n",

            "She also had to remember that the fighters pushing and pummeling inside the club have lives outside, too -- they're mothers, partners, friends. Their actions on the mat might contradict how they live the rest of their lives.\r\n",
            "Even years later, the fight club is still running and is \"better than ever,\" Mazur said.\r\n",
            "\"Very often, I was very moved after seeing and editing the pictures, realizing what exactly happened there,\" Mazur said. \"It is important to always remember my role as a photographer and to always approach the subject with interest and (an open mind).\"\r\n",

            "Married to rock star David Bowie and now residing in New York, Iman was born in Somalia in 1955. Her father was an ambassador, but her comfortable upbringing was disrupted in 1969 with the assassination of Somalia's president, forcing her and her family to flee to Kenya.\r\n",
            "\"We left Somalia with nothing but the clothes on our back. Not even photographs, nothing. So it's a total loss of everything and a total loss of your own self, your own country, your own place in terms of your people. If you're lucky you're in a country that will give you a second chance,\" she told CNN.\r\n",
            "She was lucky and her adopted home of Kenya provided her with a scholarship at Nairobi University, and it was also in the Kenyan capital that she was discovered as a model.\r\n",
            "Stopped on a Nairobi street by fashion photographer Peter Beard, she was soon signed by a top model agency and moved to New York in 1975. With her exotic looks she caused a stir in the fashion world, helped in part by a fanciful story about her background spread by Beard.\r\n",
            "\"They wanted to believe because it's kind of like 'My Fair Lady'. Everything about that article was fabricated... I was discovered herding goats and discovered in the jungle; I've never seen the jungle in my life. I was a city girl,\" she said.\r\n",
            "Iman admits she was complicit in the fabrication, suggesting an early realization that the fashion industry was built around control and manipulation.\r\n",
            "\"I had to be very clever about not over exposing myself, not under exposing myself. I had to make sure that I knew my worth that I would not settle if they gave me less. I knew how to walk away. It's very key.\"\r\n",
            "After facing numerous challenges being a black model, she launched Iman Cosmetics in 1994, designed for models no matter the color of their skin.\r\n",
            "A hugely successful catwalk career as a model ended in 1989, but she faced up to the transitory nature of her career and gained a greater sense of self long before that when she was injured in a car accident in 1983.\r\n",
            "\"Where everything was about what you do and about how you look, it changed to more security about me. It was not about 'how will I look ten years from now?' It all became about what kind of person would I be ten years from now.\r\n",

            "Hogansville, Georgia (CNN)  -- A Georgia couple arrived at the White House on the wrong day for a tour recently and got much more than they bargained for.\r\n",
            "After being screened by the Secret Service, Harvey and Paula Darden of Hogansville, Georgia, were led into a lavish invitation-only breakfast where they met the president and the first lady.\r\n",
            "How the couple was able to get into the White House event without being on the guest list was called \"dumb luck\" by the Dardens. The White House is calling it a \"nice gesture\" and has been explaining how this incident is nothing like the breach of security that took place when Tareq and Michaele Salahi infamously crashed the Obamas' state dinner.\r\n",
            "The Dardens got into the White House on Veterans Day, weeks before the Salahis' infamous party crashing. The couple mistakenly arrived a day early for a tour that was booked by their congressman.\r\n",
            "The White House says it put the Dardens through the appropriate screenings and criminal background checks before allowing them to go to the Veterans Day breakfast because there were no tours scheduled that day.\r\n",
            "Harvey Darden, 67, says the whole thing was a surprise to him because at the time he did not realize that he was at the White House on the wrong day.\r\n",
            "Darden says he was standing outside the White House security booth with his 62-year-old wife when he heard: \"Mr. and Mrs. Darden, you are cleared to come in.\"\r\n",
            "They were led directly to the grand East Room where there was a buffet and a crowd of people, some in military uniforms, some in suits.\r\n",
            "Darden says he began to get the sinking feeling that this was not the usual tour of the White House. He went to talk to a White House aide telling the staffer that he may be in the wrong place.\r\n",
            "The staffer, who Darden did not know by name, asked him if he was a veteran. When Darden said he told the staffer he was a Navy veteran, the staffer told him to stay for the breakfast.\r\n",
            "\"He said, 'Go with the flow,'\" Darden said.\r\n",
            "A White House spokesman said it was a \"nice gesture\" that has been done before for those have passed security screenings.\r\n",
            "White House spokesman Nick Shapiro said it is not uncommon for staff to take people who are cleared for tours to other events if there is space available.\r\n",
            "Shapiro said the White House Office of Public Engagement, which Obama created to engage citizens in White House activities, was responsible for clearing in the Dardens, as well as the other breakfast guests.\r\n",
            "Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan said agents performed the same screening procedures on the Dardens that were used for other breakfast guests. They checked the Dardens' names and did a criminal background check, steps that were not taken for the Salahis at the November 24 state dinner.\r\n",
            "The Dardens ate breakfast and then were startled when Obama entered the room. They got a chance to meet the president, the first lady and the vice president, Darden said.\r\n",
            "Darden said he was even more startled he returned to his Georgia home and read his e-mails with U.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland and realized he had been at the White House on the wrong day.\r\n",
            "\"It was dumb luck that a veteran of four years was able to meet the President of the U.S, who I have lots of support and respect for,\" Darden said.\r\n",

            "Religious leaders in Britain on Friday hit back at claims by leading physicist Stephen Hawking that God had no role in the creation of the universe.\r\n",
            "In his new book \"The Grand Design,\" Britain's most famous scientist says that given the existence of gravity, \"the universe can and will create itself from nothing,\" according to an excerpt published in The Times of London.\r\n",
            "\"Spontaneous creation is the reason why there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist,\" he wrote.\r\n",
            "\"It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper [fuse] and set the universe going.\"\r\n",
            "But the head of the Church of England, the Archbishop of Canterbury Dr. Rowan Williams, told the Times that \"physics on its own will not settle the question of why there is something rather than nothing.\"\r\n",
            "He added: \"Belief in God is not about plugging a gap in explaining how one thing relates to another within the Universe. It is the belief that there is an intelligent, living agent on whose activity everything ultimately depends for its existence.\"\r\n",
            "Williams' comments were supported by leaders from across the religious spectrum in Britain. Writing in the Times, Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks said: \"Science is about explanation. Religion is about interpretation ... The Bible simply isn't interested in how the Universe came into being.\"\r\n",
            "The Archbishop of Westminster Vincent Nichols, leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, added: \"I would totally endorse what the Chief Rabbi said so eloquently about the relationship between religion and science.\"\r\n",
            "Ibrahim Mogra, an imam and committee chairman at the Muslim Council of Britain, was also quoted by the Times as saying: \"If we look at the Universe and all that has been created, it indicates that somebody has been here to bring it into existence. That somebody is the almighty conqueror.\"\r\n",

            "\"Hawking's god is a god-of-the-gaps used to plug present gaps in our scientific knowledge.\r\n",
            "\"Science provides us with a wonderful narrative as to how [existence] may happen, but theology addresses the meaning of the narrative,\" he added.\r\n",
            "Read why Hawking says God didn't create the universe\r\n",
            "Fraser Watts, an Anglican priest and Cambridge expert in the history of science, said that it's not the existence of the universe that proves the existence of God.\r\n",
            "\"A creator God provides a reasonable and credible explanation of why there is a universe, and ... it is somewhat more likely that there is a God than that there is not. That view is not undermined by what Hawking has said.\"\r\n",
            "Hawking's book -- as the title suggests -- is an attempt to answer \"the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything,\" he wrote, quoting Douglas Adams' cult science fiction romp, \"The Hitch-hiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\"\r\n",
            "Read CNN's Belief Blog\r\n",
            "His answer is \"M-theory,\" which, he says, posits 11 space-time dimensions, \"vibrating strings, ... point particles, two-dimensional membranes, three-dimensional blobs and other objects that are more difficult to picture and occupy even more dimensions of space.\"\r\n",
            "He doesn't explain much of that in the excerpt, which is the introduction to the book.\r\n",
            "But he says he understands the feeling of the great English scientist Isaac Newton that God did \"create\" and \"conserve\" order in the universe.\r\n",
            "It was the discovery of other solar systems outside our own in 1992 that undercut a key idea of Newton's -- that our world was so uniquely designed to be comfortable for human life that some divine creator must have been responsible.\r\n",
            "But, Hawking argues, if there are untold numbers of planets in the galaxy, it's less remarkable that there's one with conditions for human life. And, indeed, he argues, any form of intelligent life that evolves anywhere will automatically find that it lives somewhere suitable for it.\r\n",

            "\"And each time he was knocked down,\" Gorman said, \"Banks hit their next pitch out of the park.\"\r\n",

            "And in 1977, six years after his last at-bat, Banks was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.\r\n",
            "It's no wonder, then, that he was voted the \"Greatest Cub Ever\" in a 1969 Chicago Sun-Times fan poll. After all, he was known both as \"Mr. Cub\" and \"Mr. Sunshine.\"\r\n",

            "Holder spoke about his recent trip to the area and about conversations he had with its residents.\r\n",
            "\"People consistently expressed concerns stemming from specific alleged incidents, from general policing practices and from the lack of diversity on the Ferguson police force. These anecdotal accounts underscore the history of mistrust of law enforcement in Ferguson that has received a good deal of attention,\" Holder told reporters.\r\n",
            "\"Our investigation will assess the police department's use of force, including deadly force. It will analyze stops, searches and arrests. And it will examine the treatment of individuals detained at Ferguson's city jail,\" he said.\r\n",
            "Such probes typically focus on paving the way for systemic reform going forward, rather than punishing misconduct from the past, said CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin.\r\n",
            "Nonetheless, they can produce significant changes within a department.\r\n",
            "\"It's very serious,\" Toobin said of the investigation, before it was formally announced, \"because it can lead to a virtual federal takeover of the police, as happened recently in New Orleans.\"\r\n",
            "It is distinct from the Justice Department's previously announced civil rights probe that is specific to the August 9 shooting of Brown, an unarmed African-American teenager, by Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson, who is white. Proving a civil rights violation would require showing that Wilson was actively hostile to Brown because of his race.\r\n",
            "The shooting and the fact authorities didn't immediately, and still haven't, charged Wilson spurred emotional and, at times, violent protests on the streets of Ferguson.\r\n",
            "Dozens were arrested over those tense few weeks, which were sometimes marred by looting and clashes between protesters and law enforcement.\r\n",
            "Brown's shooting also stirred up locals' gripes about Ferguson police over the years. Some of them said members of the predominantly white police force would routinely and inordinately single out African-Americans, who make up two-thirds of the St. Louis suburb's population.\r\n",
            "Residents: Police have 'a power trip problem'\r\n",
            "Many African-Americans said that they often found themselves subject to racial profiling -- such as being pulled over for no obvious reason besides, they presumed, \"DWB,\" or driving while black.\r\n",
            "Some white residents complained police have acted in a heavy-handed fashion.\r\n",
            "Chief Tom Jackson has said the claim that officers are more likely to stop blacks is more perception than reality.\r\n",

            "The family says that Moore, who they say suffered a psychological disorder, was walking around naked and posed no threat to police.\r\n",
            "It's not clear which cases, specifically, the new federal investigation will examine. The probe will not focus on law enforcement's response to Brown-related protests, since that effort involved numerous agencies and Ferguson did not lead this multi-agency effort.\r\n",
            "$40 million lawsuit slams police actions during protests\r\n",
            "Ferguson is be the latest of many local police and sheriff departments nationwide to be subject to such a federal investigation, which Toobin explains are launched \"when there are persistent allegations of misconduct.\"\r\n",
            "This April, for instance, the Justice Department lambasted police in Albuquerque, New Mexico, for what it characterized as a longstanding history of police brutality and unnecessary deadly force, sometimes \"in an unconstitutional manner.\" The report laid out several measures to address the problems, such as changing policies, training procedures and recruitment protocol.\r\n",

            "The downing of a Turkish jet over the Mediterranean last Friday by a Syrian missile took Turkish-Syrian tensions to a new level. Though the Turkish government did not declare war as some expected, and others feared, it did declare Syria a \"clear and present danger\" and raised its rules of engagement to an alert level.\r\n",
            "How we came to this point is an interesting story. The 550-mile long border with Syria, Turkey's longest, has often been tense. During the Cold War, Syria was a Soviet ally, Turkey was a NATO member (as it still is) and the border was heavily mined. Moreover, Hafez Assad, the father and predecessor of Syria's current dictator, Bashar al-Assad, supported and hosted the PKK, the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, which has led a guerrilla war against Turkey since the early '80s. (PKK is defined by Turkey and the United States as a terrorist group.) Turkey had come close to waging a war against Syria in 1999 because of this PKK connection.\r\n",
            "Turkey moves forces to Syrian border amid tensions, official says\r\n",
            "However, the relations surprisingly changed for the better in the first decade of the new century. Bashar al-Assad, who replaced his father in 2000, seemed to promise a more open and friendly Syria. In Turkey, the Justice and Development Party of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, which came to power in 2002, initiated a foreign policy of \"zero problems with neighbors.\" This led to a fruitful Turkish-Syrian rapprochment: Erdogan and Assad became friends, trade between the two countries was boosted, and borders were opened for visa-free travel. Just two years ago, the two countries looked like the core states of a would-be Middle Eastern Union modeled after the EU.\r\n",
            "But this honeymoon came to an abrupt end with the Arab Spring. The Erdogan government, whose claims include democratizing Turkey by saving it from the tutelage of the country's overbearing military, intuitively sympathized with and announced support for this democratic wave in the region. Yet while this proved to be a winning game in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, Syria turned out to be a tougher case.\r\n",
            "Throughout the initial months of the demonstrations in Syria, which began in March 2011, the Turkish government hoped and tried to persuade al-Assad's regime to allow a peaceful transition to democracy. This hope was gradually replaced by frustration, however, and Erdogan soon began to condemn the \"barbarism\" and \"savagery\" of the Syrian regime. The trouble for him, as it usually is, was also personal: As he said in the Turkish Parliament on June 21, Assad had promised him change and reform but proved to be a liar instead.\r\n",
            "Consequently, Turkey rapidly emerged as one of the boldest supporters of the Syrian opposition, and the Syrian National Council, formed as the dissidents' umbrella group, found a base in Turkey. Meanwhile, at least 15,000 refugees from Syria, both dissidents and their families, were given shelter on the Turkish side of the Syrian border.\r\n",
            "Moreover, the Free Syrian Army, a rebel group formed by the Syrian soldiers who deserted to the opposition's side, not only operated from Turkey but, according to some reports, were helped with arms and other supplies as well. The Syrian response was to add Turkey to its own version of the axis of evil -- the United States, NATO, Saudi Arabia and in fact much of the rest of the world -- in its official propaganda.\r\n",
            "Inside Turkey, this engagement in the Syrian crisis has supporters and critics. The supporters are mostly Sunni conservatives who strongly identify with the Syrian opposition, which include the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood. (The massacre of thousands of Sunnis in Hama in 1982 by Hafez Assad had been a tragic memory in the minds of these conservative Turks, who now believe that the Syrian leopard has simply not changed its spots.)\r\n",
            "Other voices in Turkey, ranging from hardcore secularists to pro-Iranian marginal Islamists, accuse the government for being naively involved in a conflict cooked up by \"Western imperialists.\"\r\n",
            "The plane incident came on top of all this. The downed jet was apparently an unarmed but military aircraft which, according to the Turkish government, was on a peaceful mission to test the NATO radar system based in eastern Turkey. Syrians said the plane violated Syrian airspace and was shot within it.\r\n",
            "The Turkish government said the plane violated the Syrian airspace \"mistakenly and very briefly\" but was hit by a Syrian missile despite immediately having reverted to international airspace. The plane's two pilots, who apparently fell to the sea, are missing.\r\n",
            "The Turkish reaction to the incident was outlined by Erdogan in an address in the parliament that came four days after the incident. In a very strident tone against the \"bloody dictator of Syria,\" Erdogan announced that Turkey now sees its southern neighbor as a \"clear and present danger\" and will change its rules of engagement: \"Any military element that approaches the Turkish border from Syria by posing a security risk will be regarded as a threat, and will be treated as a military target.\" The very same day, some Turkish tanks on the Syrian border were repositioned, implying that Ankara meant business.\r\n",
            "Yet almost no one in Turkey seems enthusiastic for war. Many here point out that Turkey's ascendance in the past decade has been thanks to its \"soft power.\" That mainly rested on the country's economic boom and democratic reforms, which seemed to present a synthesis of Islam, free-market capitalism and political liberalism.\r\n",
            "Photos: In Syrian hospital, no escape from war\r\n",

            "A year after CNN investigated a California charity that said it was helping veterans, the California Attorney General's office on Friday announced the charity would pay a $2.5 million fine and agree to the resignation of most of its principal officers because it had spent most of its donations on fundraising and what the state called \"excessive compensation\" for its executives.\r\n",
            "Attorney General Kamala Harris said Help Hospitalized Veterans executives had \"improperly diverted\" donated funds to themselves as well as purchasing country club memberships and in one case a suburban Washington condominium for use of its officers.\r\n",

            "When CNN investigated Help Hospitalized Veterans in August 2012, it found that most of the donations sent to veterans hospitals around the country amounted to so-called \"craft kits\" for recovering soldiers to use while hospitalized. The kits included instructions for making paper airplanes. Tax returns from Help Hospitalized Veterans showed six-figure salary payments to several of its key officers, including Chief Executive Officer Michael Lynch.\r\n",
            "At the time, Lynch told CNN in a brief on-camera statement, \"We hope these unproven allegations will not diminish the more than 40 years of service HHV has provided to our nation's most valuable treasure, our veterans. HHV looks forward to the chance to tell its story and we hope this action will not impede its ability to add its support to hospitalized veterans nationwide.\"\r\n",
            "Help Hospitalized Veterans has been the subject of state and federal inquiries for several years. In 2008, a House Oversight Subcommittee hearing led by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California, spent a day seeking testimony from the charity's founder, Roger Chapin, as well as other Help Hospitalized Veterans executives. Chapin died last month. Waxman told CNN in 2012 that in his view, executives of the charity \"ought to be put in jail\" because of excessive spending.\r\n",

The remaining $2 million will eventually be paid from the estate of Chapin's wife, Quinn said. Lynch will retire after 35 years and will collect a pension of $160,000 per year, Quinn said.\r\n",

Madoff bilked investors out of $50 billion by masquerading his investment firm as legitimate when it was nothing more than a front. He used funds from new investors to send payments to his earlier investors, falsely portraying them as proceeds from investments, when they were actually stolen money, prosecutors said.\r\n",

            "\"We found that there were 80,000-plus children in Alabama living in a home with no car,\" Jackson says.\r\n",
            "\"And in the rural areas, there are no cabs, there are no buses, there are no trains. ... Millions of children in our country every day have no access to medical care when they need to reach it.\"\r\n",
            "Jackson is so determined that in 1997 he gave up his career as an Alabama firefighter, moved in with friends and dug into his retirement account to start Kid One Transport, a nonprofit organization that provides rides for needy children in his home state.\r\n",

            "But an emergency call to his department in March 1992 changed everything. Jackson was dispatched to help an unresponsive 2-year-old who had accidentally hanged himself in the family car while trying to retrieve a toy.\r\n",
            "\"We did everything that we could to try to revive that young child,\" he says. The 2-year-old died despite their efforts.\r\n",
            "\"I took it pretty tough,\" Jackson remembers. \"It's not that I had not been exposed to tragedies before, but this one hit me differently.\"\r\n",
            "At the advice of a counselor, Jackson started volunteer work to help him process his grief. A friend suggested Jackson volunteer in the small rural town of Sayre, Alabama. Jackson was stunned by what he saw just 25 minutes from his home.\r\n",
            "\"When I drove into the community, it was a world of its own. It was a lot of homes that were deplorable. And that's really the only way I can explain them,\" he says.\r\n",
            "Jackson says he was instantly ashamed by his own comfortable lifestyle.  Watch Jackson describe the \"turning point\" that led to Kids One Transport Â»\r\n",
            "\"All it took was the one visit,\" he recalls, \"and I knew I really wanted to come out and work with these folks, hand in hand, and do whatever I could to help make life a little bit easier for them.\"\r\n",
            "When social workers told him about the neighborhood children who had no way to travel to and from appointments for chemotherapy, physical therapy and even for regular checkups, Jackson started driving them there himself.\r\n",
            "Before long this one-man operation grew into a 13-van team covering 30 counties. Though Jackson recently stepped down from a daily role in the organization he founded, he says the best part of his work has been meeting the families and witnessing firsthand so many medical transformations.\r\n",

            "\"We're that missing part of the puzzle that is preventing so many people from reaching what we'd consider as world-class medicine. ... To know that they beat it all because of a simple ride,\" he adds. \"That has definitely been worth every bit of founding Kid One Transport.\"\r\n",

            "The prime minister's spokeswoman, Olga Lappo, confirmed to CNN the quotes attributed to Yatsenyuk are accurate.\r\n",

            "I am tired of having to march to have murderers arrested. Tired of worrying about my 17-year-old being gunned down by some random white guy who thinks his music is too loud.  Tired of knowing the same could happen to me.\r\n",
            "I am tired of seeing a hashtag in front of a victim's name on Twitter. Tired of seeing Al Sharpton speak on behalf of a family. Tired of waiting for verdicts and hoping for justice --as if hearing \"guilty\" can ease the anxiety of knowing a police officer shot and killed a 22-year-old black man while he was lying face down and with his hands behind his back.\r\n",
            "I'm tired of the cynics who are quick to extend the benefit of the doubt to a gunman but hesitant to do the same for an unarmed teenage girl who had been shot in the face. I am tired of seeing images of police officers with snarling dogs threatening a crowd of black protesters and not knowing if it's from the 1960s or last week.\r\n",
            "In the case of Michael Brown's death in Ferguson, Missouri, it's the latter. Witnesses said he was shot multiple times from 35 feet away after his hands were raised. Again, he was unarmed.\r\n",
            "I am tired of the U.S. Department of Justice having to closely watch local authorities. I am tired of local authorities advocating for Stop and Frisk one minute and dismissing the notion of racial profiling the next. I am tired of the charlatans who chase the bodies of innocent victims the way sleazy lawyers chase ambulances. I hate black looters at peaceful rallies the way I hate the KKK.\r\n",

            "I don't begrudge anyone who has the luxury of not knowing what that kind of siege feels like. I just hope they have the decency not to characterize the socioeconomic disparity along racial lines as a card to be played but rather recognize it as a looming element of our cultural fiber.\r\n",
            "For example, from 1934 to 1962, the federal government backed $120 billion of home loans. Because of an appraisal system that deemed integrated communities financial risks, less than 2% of those loans went to minorities.\r\n",
            "When you consider that home ownership has long been the prerequisite for the average American to acquire wealth, there is little wonder why white Americans have 22 times more wealth than blacks. That is not a card being played. That is math. And I'm tired of having to explain that.\r\n",
            "Just as I'm tired of watching the video of Eric Garner being placed in a chokehold by NYPD, listening to him say \"I can't breathe, I can't breathe\" and then watching him die minutes later.\r\n",
            "But I need to keep watching because apathy is a clever hunter. It cloaks itself with FBI statistics and slips into the system between runs to Starbucks. Then one day as you're sipping your grande decaf mocha, you see a headline about an unarmed black man being shot and killed by police and think nothing of it.\r\n",
            "Or worse yet -- assume he did something to deserve it.\r\n",
            "I'm tired of unarmed dead black people being put on trial. I'm tired of politicians visiting our churches for votes but skipping out on these funerals\r\n",

hope to help themselves as well as provide assistance to other areas of the local economy. the main vision was to always make sure that there is labor supply always available to work at the factory. the excess can go and work in other industries in the country barungi said. more from marketplace africa \n"
